# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Unity EPL

This library is intended to enable the rapid development of high performance psychology experiments using Unity. Using this library ensures consistent logging of all task events as well as concurrent handling of network communication. 

## Getting Started

After cloning this repository, move the `configs` and `resources` folders to your desktop. These files contain external resources needed to run UnityEPL tasks and allow configuration of tasks without re compiling. When running from the editory, UnityEPL looks for these folders on the desktop. In a build, these folders should be in the same location as the task.
